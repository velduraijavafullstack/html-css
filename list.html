    <h3>Mythical Creatures</h3>
    <dl style="background-color: lightsalmon;border: 2px solid;">
      <dt>Dragon</dt>
      <dd>A dragon is usually represented as a huge, bat-winged, fire-breathing, scaly lizard or snake with a barbed tail. The belief in these creatures apparently arose without the slightest knowledge on the part of the ancients of dinosaurs, which have some remblance to dragons.</dd>
      <dt>Phoenix</dt>
      <dd>The phoenix is an immortal bird associated with Greek mythology (with analogs in many cultures such as Egyptian and Persian) that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. Associated with the sun, a phoenix obtains new life by rising from the ashes of its predecessor.</dd>
      <dt>Vampire</dt>
      <dd>Vampires are supposedly dead humans (originally suicides, heretics, or criminals) who maintain a kind of life by biting the necks of living humans and sucking their blood; their victims also become vampires after death. These “undead” creatures cast no shadow and are not reflected in mirrors.</dd>
      <dt>Werewolf</dt>
      <dd>werewolf, in European folklore, a man who turns into a wolf at night and devours animals, people, or corpses but returns to human form by day.</dd>
